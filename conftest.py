Sets ``AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`` for the test process so any lazily-built
``boto3.client(...)`` (e.g. ``evals/orchestrator.py``'s CloudWatch
client when ``cloudwatch_client`` isn't injected) succeeds without
``NoRegionError``. Production Lambdas inherit ``AWS_REGION`` from the
runtime; tests without this default fail in CI where no region is
configured. moto's mocked services also require region to be set.
